## ‚ÑπÔ∏èIntroduction

Welcome to **Awesome Precommit**! This repository is a curated collection of pre-commit hooks, tools, and resources designed to help developers automate and improve their workflows. Whether you're working on a small personal project or a large-scale team effort, pre-commit hooks can save you time, enforce coding standards, and catch errors before they make it into your codebase.

This list includes hooks for linting, formatting, security checks, documentation, testing, and more. Contributions are welcome, so feel free to suggest new hooks or improvements!

### What is Pre-commit?

Pre-commit is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. These hooks are scripts or tools that run automatically before you commit code to your repository. They help enforce coding standards, catch errors, and ensure consistency across your codebase.

### Why Use Pre-commit?

- **Automate Code Quality Checks**: Run linters, formatters, and other tools automatically.
- **Catch Errors Early**: Identify issues before they reach your repository.
- **Enforce Consistency**: Ensure all team members follow the same coding standards.
- **Save Time**: Reduce manual effort by automating repetitive tasks.

Pre-commit hooks are highly customizable and can be tailored to fit the needs of any project.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

To get started with pre-commit, you'll need to install the `pre-commit` package. You can do this using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

#### Adding Pre-commit to Your Project

1. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of your project.
2. Add the hooks you want to use. Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.9.1
    hooks:
      - id: black

  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8
    rev: 6.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
```

3. Install the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

4. Run the hooks manually on all files: 

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Basic Commands

- **Install hooks**: `pre-commit install`
- **Run hooks manually**: `pre-commit run`
- **Run hooks on all files**: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- **Update hooks**: `pre-commit autoupdate`

Now you're ready to use pre-commit hooks in your project! Explore the list of hooks below to find tools that fit your needs.
