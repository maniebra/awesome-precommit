## Tutorial


### What is Flake8?

Flake8 is a powerful Python tool that checks your code against coding style (PEP8), programming errors (like "syntax errors"), and complexity issues. It's an essential tool for maintaining clean, consistent, and maintainable Python code.

### Why Use Flake8 with Pre-Commit?

Integrating Flake8 as a pre-commit hook ensures that every commit adheres to your project's style and linting guidelines. This prevents errors or bad style from slipping into your codebase.

### Installation via Pre-Commit Hook

To integrate Flake8 into your repository using `pre-commit`, add the following configuration to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-flake8
    rev: v6.1.0  # Replace with the latest version
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
```

### Customizing Flake8

To customize Flake8, you can add a configuration file named `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, or `.flake8` in your project root:

```ini
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
ignore = E203, E266, E501, W503
exclude = .git,__pycache__,old,build,dist
```

- **`max-line-length`:** Sets the maximum line length (e.g., 88 for compatibility with Black).
- **`ignore`:** Ignore specific warnings or errors (e.g., Black compatibility).
- **`exclude`:** Exclude specific directories or files from linting.

### Running Flake8 Manually

If needed, you can manually run Flake8 locally:

```bash
flake8 path/to/your/code/
```

### Advanced Tips

- Combine Flake8 with tools like [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) in your pre-commit setup for comprehensive formatting and linting.
- Use Flake8 plugins like `flake8-bugbear` to catch common issues or `flake8-comprehensions` for optimizing comprehensions.
